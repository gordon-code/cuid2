# Contribute

This is the contribute.md of our project. Great to have you here. Here are a few ways you can help make this project better!

If you want to add an issue or pull request, please ensure that the [existing issues](https://github.com/overflowdigital/cuid2py/issues) don't already cover your question or contribution.

## Installation

We recommend using [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) to isolate dependencies for development.
This guide assumes that you have already created and activated a virtualenv for this project.

Ensure that you have the latest version of pip installed:
```
pip install -U pip
```

Clone the repository (alternatively, if you plan on making a pull request and are not in the cuid2.py organisation, use the [github page](https://github.com/overflowdigital/cuid2py) to create your own fork)
```
git clone git@github.com:overflowdigital/cuid2py.git
cd cuid2py
```

And finally create a separate branch to begin work
```
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```

## Submitting Pull Requests

Pull requests are welcomed! We'd like to review the design and implementation as early as
possible so please submit the pull request even if it's not 100%.
Let us know the purpose of the change and list the remaining items which need to be
addressed before merging. Finally, PR's should include unit tests and documentation
where appropriate.
